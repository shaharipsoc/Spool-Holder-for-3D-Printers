The Filler is a unique spool holder that stands out for its ease of mounting. It features bearings for smooth unspooling and a host of premade attachments to accommodate a wide range of printers. There are even standalone and wall-mounted options for maximal flexibility.

In some cases, filament may roll off the spool when nearing its end. However, placing the spool above the printer can solve this problem.

deal temperatures vary between materials (ABS: 220-250 °C, PETG: 220-245 °C), but the brand of filament can also make a difference. When trying a new filament, it’s a great idea to print a temperature tower. In general, we find 200 °C a great average temperature for PLA.
